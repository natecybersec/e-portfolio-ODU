                    areas that
                    you would want to focus your career on? Explain which areas would
                    appeal the most to you and which would appeal the least.</span></li>
            <li>
                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    Focusing your skills in cybersecurity is incredibly important because the field is vast and
                    expansive, and will only continue to keep expanding. Thus, it may be easier to hone your
                    edge at a select few areas. The NICE framework lays out a beneficial guide to these areas
                    and the jobs within them that need to be filled. There are three areas that I am most
                    interested in: Analyze, Collect and Operate, and Investigate. First, within the Analyze
                    area, exploitation/threat analysis seems very enticing me. Collecting data and studying the
                    ways in which systems are vulnerable, or become vulnerable, seems like a great way to learn
                    and gain experience in the industry. Second, within the Collect and Operate area, cyber
                    operations is appealing to me because it feels very hands-on, and in my opinion that is one
                    of the best ways to grow in anything. That is also where I feel a lot of work actually gets
                    done, and the reward is very clear. Last, in the Investigate section, Digital Forensics has
                    always enticed me ever since I first heard about it, due to the fact that you’re actively
                    helping solve crime cases. The three areas that I wouldn’t explicitly look to join would be
                    Operate and Maintain, Oversee and Govern, and Securely Provision. First, specifically in
                    Operate and Maintain, customer service and tech support do not excite me at all due to the
                    fact that I’m not a very good communicator in the moment, and that type of work requires you
                    to be very stoic and clear-headed, and that doesn’t really fit my personality very well.
                    Second, within Oversee and govern, training and educating people doesn’t speak to me because
                    I do not view myself as the educator type. Last, within Securely Provision, testing and
                    evaluating products or services seems to be a very mundane career, and I feel like I would
                    get bored with that line of work very quickly, and become disinterested.

                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    The principles of science relate to cybersecurity in a variety of ways, including the
                    scientific method, collecting data and analyzing it, and sharing newfound knowledge with the
                    community. Cybersecurity experts use the scientific method every day, whether or not they
                    realize it. Theorizing how a certain system or software is vulnerable, and testing that
                    theory by performing a hack is very similar to drafting a hypothesis and then testing it.
                    The collection of data and analyzing that data is also extremely important to the field of
                    cybersecurity, including those who specialize in packet analysis or incident response.
                    Lastly, sharing gained knowledge is extremely important as it is in the field of science
                    because it helps to keep regular users in the loop, as well as educate experts on how to
                    better protect their own systems.

                    relates to your experiences with technology. Give specific examples of

                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    There are a multitude of digital experiences that have filled my needs as it relates to
                    Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. For self-actualization, I’ve used digital technology as a
                    creative outlet, as some of my hobbies now include 3D modeling and game development.
                    Although, I don’t think I’ve realized my “full potential” in those outlets, but I feel that
                    I still have plenty of time left to do so. For my esteem needs, I usually enjoy video games
                    that allow you to progress as you play, and that progression gives me a feeling of
                    accomplishment. Whether or not that’s considered “worthwhile”, that’s up to the individual
                    in my opinion. For belonging needs, I use social media to talk to my friends regularly,
                    something that I don’t think I could have done without it, as most of my friends live pretty
                    far away from me. For safety needs, the fact that I can get alerts straight to my phone
                    about bad weather is extremely beneficial, as well as the alarms in my house are all
                    automated, so I don’t have to worry about not knowing if there is someone breaking into my
                    house is also very nice. For physiological needs, I can order food and water with a click of
                    a button from an app, and can also use apps to track how well I slept during the night,
                    which meets those needs very well.

                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    I rank the “political” motive number one because it makes the most sense out of all the
                    motives, due to the fact that politics is extremely controversial by nature and such an area
                    can turn anyone into an activist about anything if they dive in far enough. I rank the “for
                    money” motive a close second, because money is an extremely valuable resource to literally
                    everyone, and it does not come as a surprise at all that people may commit cybercrime for
                    financial gain. I rank the “revenge” motive as third because those who might feel they’ve
                    been egregiously wronged in some way might make drastic decisions as a result of that
                    feeling. I rank the “recognition” motive fourth due to the fact that its very easy for the
                    act of finding vulnerabilities to become a competition of sorts, and if you’re the first
                    person to find a vulnerability, it’s a good demonstration of your hacking abilities for all
                    to see. I rank the “multiple reasons” motive fifth, because while it’s definitely
                    understandable that someone’s view of the world influences their decisions, there seems to
                    be a stronger motive under that layer, like financial gain and political activism. I rank
                    the “entertainment” motive sixth because while a lot of people partake in activities just
                    for fun, another aspect of said activity allows people to willingly spend more time on it
                    that is more enticing. An example from the article is that even thought he perpetrator said
                    he did it for fun, he ended up auctioning off the data for money anyways. I rank the
                    “boredom” motive last because from what I read in the article it didn’t really seem like a
                    motive in the first place versus something that gets individuals caught in a trap. Even
                    then, it seems like a little weak because boredom is just a symptom of an underlying problem
                    that causes you to take action.

                    websites and ask
                    them to spot what makes them fake?</span></li>
            <li>
                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    The average person might not be aware of the differences between a real website that they
                    intend to use, and a malicious website that acts a front to gather information about an
                    individual that intentionally appears legitimate. There are various differences in a fake
                    website that should appear as red flags to a user. Firstly, the most common feature of a
                    fake website is that the domain name may not appear correct. Even if a hacker has setup a
                    website to look like an exact replica, the hacker cannot use the same domain name of the
                    real one. Secondly, web browsers provide a symbol next to the URL that looks like a padlock
                    or another related icon. Clicking on the icon allows you to view the digital certificate of
                    the website, and almost all trustworthy sites will provide a legitimate certification to
                    allow secure connections. If the padlock symbol has a warning sign on it, that may mean the
                    digital certificate is not valid, and cannot be trusted. Lastly, if a user feels that they
                    are not sure they have arrived at the correct website, either through a referral link from
                    an email, or otherwise, the user can always manually go to the intended website themselves
                    and perform the necessary activities from there. Users should look carefully at domain
                    names, and ensure that they are spelled correctly, with no extra characters included to make
                    the domain name appear legitimate. For example, a hacker looking to imitate
                    ‘www.facebook.com’ may register the malicious address as ‘www.face.book.com’. If a URL does
                    not appear to be spelled correctly, the user should not remain there. If a web browser warns
                    you that a digital certificate could be not be validated, that may indicate that the website
                    is unsafe, and users should take heed of said warnings.
