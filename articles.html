                            Securing the Human: A Review of Literature on Broadening Diversity in Cybersecurity Education demonstrates the opportunity to diversify the field of cybersecurity and the development of a diverse workforce of proficient computer scientists. This study includes interpretive data collection, through the method of observing and reviewing “literature concentrating on cybersecurity education initiatives for diversification”. There are three research questions present: “What is the current body of work concerning the diversification of the cybersecurity field”, “What are the gaps in education research for the diversification of the cybersecurity field”, and “What approaches are successful or unsuccessful in diversifying the cybersecurity field”. The study utilizes a variety of research methods, including “Open Literature Search Methodology”, “Focused Literature Search Methodology”, and “Coding Results”. The first phase, Open Literature Search Methodology, is defined in the study as “a broad review of literature based on standard approaches employed to increase participation in computing and cybersecurity”. Every member of the study’s working group formed a list of interventions to report on based on their experiences as educators. Each intervention was compared to evidence that had been studied heavily for its efficacy in Computer Science/STEM fields. The second phase, Focused Literature Search Methodology, involved a more specific group of keyword search terms in the ACM Digital Library, including terms like “cybersecurity diversity or under-representation or minorities”. All phases of the study used qualitative analysis to review the literature that was found. This study was effective at understanding cybersecurity through a social lens, as it highlighted the need for more guidelines for educators on how to foster a diverse educational community, in order to respond to the lack thereof. Overall, this study provided methods for educators to help entice and retain a diverse field of students who can join the cybersecurity field. </p>
