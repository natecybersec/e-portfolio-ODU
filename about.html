                <li class="about-primary-caption primary-text">Moving to Jordan is the farthest back in my past that I can remember, albeit for very good reason. 
                    Jordan holds a lot of the building blocks of my life, along with being one of the greatest countries I've lived in.
                    The school that I attended was called "ACS", which stands for "American Community School". I met one of my best friends who I still
                    hang out with today, in Jordan at ACS. Also around this time is when I first remember discovering and being active on the internet.
                    My favorite website was called YouTube, a video-hosting website that had came out a couple years earlier but was 
                    just starting to take off. I also remember frequenting flash game sites, which is where a passion for game development started to grow.</li>

                    and I made a lot of great friends while I was there. I also became increasingly interested in computers and how they were built.
                    I made plans to build my own at some point.</li>
