                            Focusing your skills in cybersecurity is incredibly important because the field is vast and
                            expansive, and will only continue to keep expanding. Thus, it may be easier to hone your
                            edge at a select few areas. The NICE framework lays out a beneficial guide to these areas
                            and the jobs within them that need to be filled. There are three areas that I am most
                            interested in: Analyze, Collect and Operate, and Investigate. First, within the Analyze
                            area, exploitation/threat analysis seems very enticing me. Collecting data and studying the
                            ways in which systems are vulnerable, or become vulnerable, seems like a great way to learn
                            and gain experience in the industry. Second, within the Collect and Operate area, cyber
                            operations is appealing to me because it feels very hands-on, and in my opinion that is one
                            of the best ways to grow in anything. That is also where I feel a lot of work actually gets
                            done, and the reward is very clear. Last, in the Investigate section, Digital Forensics has
                            always enticed me ever since I first heard about it, due to the fact that you’re actively
                            helping solve crime cases. The three areas that I wouldn’t explicitly look to join would be
                            Operate and Maintain, Oversee and Govern, and Securely Provision. First, specifically in
                            Operate and Maintain, customer service and tech support do not excite me at all due to the
                            fact that I’m not a very good communicator in the moment, and that type of work requires you
                            to be very stoic and clear-headed, and that doesn’t really fit my personality very well.
                            Second, within Oversee and govern, training and educating people doesn’t speak to me because
                            I do not view myself as the educator type. Last, within Securely Provision, testing and
                            evaluating products or services seems to be a very mundane career, and I feel like I would
                            get bored with that line of work very quickly, and become disinterested.</p>

                            The principles of science relate to cybersecurity in a variety of ways, including the
                            scientific method, collecting data and analyzing it, and sharing newfound knowledge with the
                            community. Cybersecurity experts use the scientific method every day, whether or not they
                            realize it. Theorizing how a certain system or software is vulnerable, and testing that
                            theory by performing a hack is very similar to drafting a hypothesis and then testing it.
                            The collection of data and analyzing that data is also extremely important to the field of
                            cybersecurity, including those who specialize in packet analysis or incident response.
                            Lastly, sharing gained knowledge is extremely important as it is in the field of science
                            because it helps to keep regular users in the loop, as well as educate experts on how to
                            better protect their own systems. </p>

                            Researchers might use the information to study data breaches by looking at the common themes
                            among them. If patterns are to be found, they can prove extremely useful in breaking the
                            cycle and preventing more breaches in the future. Common vulnerabilities like stolen
                            passwords, outdated software, or social engineering are all common patterns that a
                            researcher might be able to prevent in the future. </p>

                            There are a multitude of digital experiences that have filled my needs as it relates to
                            Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. For self-actualization, I’ve used digital technology as a
                            creative outlet, as some of my hobbies now include 3D modeling and game development.
                            Although, I don’t think I’ve realized my “full potential” in those outlets, but I feel that
                            I still have plenty of time left to do so. For my esteem needs, I usually enjoy video games
                            that allow you to progress as you play, and that progression gives me a feeling of
                            accomplishment. Whether or not that’s considered “worthwhile”, that’s up to the individual
                            in my opinion. For belonging needs, I use social media to talk to my friends regularly,
                            something that I don’t think I could have done without it, as most of my friends live pretty
                            far away from me. For safety needs, the fact that I can get alerts straight to my phone
                            about bad weather is extremely beneficial, as well as the alarms in my house are all
                            automated, so I don’t have to worry about not knowing if there is someone breaking into my
                            house is also very nice. For physiological needs, I can order food and water with a click of
                            a button from an app, and can also use apps to track how well I slept during the night,
                            which meets those needs very well. </p>

                    <button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg bg-white text-dark border border-dark fs-2" type="button"
                        data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#weekfive" aria-expanded="false"
                        aria-controls="collapseExample" style="position: relative;">Week 5</button>
                    <div class="collapse" id="weekfive">
                        <p class="fs-4 fw-normal px-2"
                            style="color: #261616; position: relative; border: 4px solid #261616; border-radius: 5px;">
                            I rank the “political” motive number one because it makes the most sense out of all the
                            motives, due to the fact that politics is extremely controversial by nature and such an area
                            can turn anyone into an activist about anything if they dive in far enough. I rank the “for
                            money” motive a close second, because money is an extremely valuable resource to literally
                            everyone, and it does not come as a surprise at all that people may commit cybercrime for
                            financial gain. I rank the “revenge” motive as third because those who might feel they’ve
                            been egregiously wronged in some way might make drastic decisions as a result of that
                            feeling. I rank the “recognition” motive fourth due to the fact that its very easy for the
                            act of finding vulnerabilities to become a competition of sorts, and if you’re the first
                            person to find a vulnerability, it’s a good demonstration of your hacking abilities for all
                            to see. I rank the “multiple reasons” motive fifth, because while it’s definitely
                            understandable that someone’s view of the world influences their decisions, there seems to
                            be a stronger motive under that layer, like financial gain and political activism. I rank
                            the “entertainment” motive sixth because while a lot of people partake in activities just
                            for fun, another aspect of said activity allows people to willingly spend more time on it
                            that is more enticing. An example from the article is that even thought he perpetrator said
                            he did it for fun, he ended up auctioning off the data for money anyways. I rank the
                            “boredom” motive last because from what I read in the article it didn’t really seem like a
                            motive in the first place versus something that gets individuals caught in a trap. Even
                            then, it seems like a little weak because boredom is just a symptom of an underlying problem
                            that causes you to take action. </p>
