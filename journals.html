                        Cybersecurity is a field that I’ve been interested in since high school. Ever since I started
                        learning about computers and how they work, I’ve applied the same ideas and logic to how the
                        software and hardware I use functions in my every day life. First, one of my primary reasonings
                        for actually taking steps to join the field is because of just how important the work is. It
                        feels like every time I watch the news there’s a new cybersecurity incident unfolding or even
                        ones that happened in the past that was never revealed to the general public. Its hard for us to
                        come to terms with how these attacks will impact society right up until it affects each and
                        every one of us individually. Within that same context, the offense only evolves as the defense
                        evolves, which makes cybersecurity technology an ever-changing, albeit interesting concept.
                        There’s always something new to learn. Secondly, as general technologies evolve, cybersecurity
                        technologies are essentially attached at the hip. This allows lots of opportunities for the
                        knowledge bubble to expand and encapsulate, so you never feel stuck where you are. Due to this
                        fact, a person within this industry can also seek to diversify their skills and strengths with
                        relative ease. For myself personally, I very much enjoy the idea of being able to move around in
                        the space, while still retaining the skills I have learned and not throwing them to waste. This
                        leads me to my third point, which is that since the field is growing at a rapid pace, the job
                        demand is quite large. There are many different types of paths you can go down specifically
                        within the cybersecurity field, which presents a ton of opportunities. Lastly, the future of
                        cybersecurity looks extremely positive, and its importance will grow as human innovation and
                        technology grows, which excites me greatly. </p>

                        Cybersecurity plays a vital role in virtually everything we participate in via the internet. Because of this, many other college majors besides cybersecurity can transition a lot of the skills and knowledge gained. These majors include Computer Science, Criminology, Engineering, and Business Administration and Management. Building a foundation in cybersecurity almost certainly requires additional disciplines to be added to your repetoire. Skills and knowledge gained throughout should prove beneficial to a cybersecurity major, regardless of the path they decide to take within the field later on. Cybersecurity is a continuously evolving discipline, and with the intrinsic need to adapt to changes, comes an obligation to learn and discover. This also allows for students to pursue other careers outside of cybersecurity. Computer science majors can bring a solid understanding of the way in which computer systems operate and then apply that knowledge to cybersecurity. Knowledge of computer programming languages and how data is structured is hugely beneficial. Business administration and management majors would be able to use their understanding of the processes of running a business and handling large amounts of business-related data, to build a foundation for ways to protect it through cybersecurity. These processes include risk identification and assessment and implementing strategies to mitigate said risk. Engineering majors can put to use their knowledge of how hardware and/or software is designed, to create a low-level understanding of how systems are penetrated by attackers, as well as thinking up new defenses. Criminology majors and the insight into the criminal justice system that is gained can be absolutely beneficial to a cybersecurity major. With an additional understanding of criminal behavior and pattern recognition, criminology majors can use that information to stop threat actors. Since cybercrime is handled by law enforcement, students can use their understanding of they way law enforcement operates to apprehend cyber-criminals. </p>

                        Electronic information, according to the “Information Technology Resource Management Glossary”, is known as “any information stored in a format that enables it to be read, processed, manipulated, or transmitted by an information system.” Electronic information can be stored on devices like USB drives, hard drives, or even on a remote server. A variety of ethical issues involved in storing electronic information about individuals come to mind. First, an issue that is still very controversial to this day is that most of the public are not aware of what information about them is being stored, much less the specifics of said information. This means that individuals may not be able to give their consent to store information in an informative manner, and if the information becomes leaked, they may be surprised to learn how much unwanted information will be released to the internet. In addition to this, an individual’s information that they may want to keep private may be accessed by insiders of companies, most notably social media providers like TikTok and Facebook. These actions could result in a serious violation of one’s privacy rights here in the United States. Electronic information about an individual that is stored could also misrepresent an individual, as the information could be inaccurate, especially concerning the age of the data versus the individual’s current and up-to-date information. This gets especially complicated when considering that companies often partake in selling user data to advertising partners. Fortunately for the average user, there are ways to take control of their data and the specifics of what is stored by different companies or organizations. Users should always read the fine print when prompted with data collection, as they can learn more about how an organization stores user data and the contents of what they are storing. Individuals will find that some companies will actually let one opt out, thus negating ethical issues. If it’s the case that you can’t fully opt-out, even then a user should be able to opt out of the selling of their data to other organizations. The ethical issues that arise from storing electronic information about a user should be clear to all organizations who take part, and should be done in a manner that respects an individual’s rights. </p>
