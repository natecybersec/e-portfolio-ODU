                    areas that
                    you would want to focus your career on? Explain which areas would
                    appeal the most to you and which would appeal the least.</span></li>
            <li>
                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    Focusing your skills in cybersecurity is incredibly important because the field is vast and
                    expansive, and will only continue to keep expanding. Thus, it may be easier to hone your
                    edge at a select few areas. The NICE framework lays out a beneficial guide to these areas
                    and the jobs within them that need to be filled. There are three areas that I am most
                    interested in: Analyze, Collect and Operate, and Investigate. First, within the Analyze
                    area, exploitation/threat analysis seems very enticing me. Collecting data and studying the
                    ways in which systems are vulnerable, or become vulnerable, seems like a great way to learn
                    and gain experience in the industry. Second, within the Collect and Operate area, cyber
                    operations is appealing to me because it feels very hands-on, and in my opinion that is one
                    of the best ways to grow in anything. That is also where I feel a lot of work actually gets
                    done, and the reward is very clear. Last, in the Investigate section, Digital Forensics has
                    always enticed me ever since I first heard about it, due to the fact that you’re actively
                    helping solve crime cases. The three areas that I wouldn’t explicitly look to join would be
                    Operate and Maintain, Oversee and Govern, and Securely Provision. First, specifically in
                    Operate and Maintain, customer service and tech support do not excite me at all due to the
                    fact that I’m not a very good communicator in the moment, and that type of work requires you
                    to be very stoic and clear-headed, and that doesn’t really fit my personality very well.
                    Second, within Oversee and govern, training and educating people doesn’t speak to me because
                    I do not view myself as the educator type. Last, within Securely Provision, testing and
                    evaluating products or services seems to be a very mundane career, and I feel like I would
                    get bored with that line of work very quickly, and become disinterested.

                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    The principles of science relate to cybersecurity in a variety of ways, including the
                    scientific method, collecting data and analyzing it, and sharing newfound knowledge with the
                    community. Cybersecurity experts use the scientific method every day, whether or not they
                    realize it. Theorizing how a certain system or software is vulnerable, and testing that
                    theory by performing a hack is very similar to drafting a hypothesis and then testing it.
                    The collection of data and analyzing that data is also extremely important to the field of
                    cybersecurity, including those who specialize in packet analysis or incident response.
                    Lastly, sharing gained knowledge is extremely important as it is in the field of science
                    because it helps to keep regular users in the loop, as well as educate experts on how to
                    better protect their own systems.

                    relates to your experiences with technology. Give specific examples of

                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    There are a multitude of digital experiences that have filled my needs as it relates to
                    Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. For self-actualization, I’ve used digital technology as a
                    creative outlet, as some of my hobbies now include 3D modeling and game development.
                    Although, I don’t think I’ve realized my “full potential” in those outlets, but I feel that
                    I still have plenty of time left to do so. For my esteem needs, I usually enjoy video games
                    that allow you to progress as you play, and that progression gives me a feeling of
                    accomplishment. Whether or not that’s considered “worthwhile”, that’s up to the individual
                    in my opinion. For belonging needs, I use social media to talk to my friends regularly,
                    something that I don’t think I could have done without it, as most of my friends live pretty
                    far away from me. For safety needs, the fact that I can get alerts straight to my phone
                    about bad weather is extremely beneficial, as well as the alarms in my house are all
                    automated, so I don’t have to worry about not knowing if there is someone breaking into my
                    house is also very nice. For physiological needs, I can order food and water with a click of
                    a button from an app, and can also use apps to track how well I slept during the night,
                    which meets those needs very well.

                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    I rank the “political” motive number one because it makes the most sense out of all the
                    motives, due to the fact that politics is extremely controversial by nature and such an area
                    can turn anyone into an activist about anything if they dive in far enough. I rank the “for
                    money” motive a close second, because money is an extremely valuable resource to literally
                    everyone, and it does not come as a surprise at all that people may commit cybercrime for
                    financial gain. I rank the “revenge” motive as third because those who might feel they’ve
                    been egregiously wronged in some way might make drastic decisions as a result of that
                    feeling. I rank the “recognition” motive fourth due to the fact that its very easy for the
                    act of finding vulnerabilities to become a competition of sorts, and if you’re the first
                    person to find a vulnerability, it’s a good demonstration of your hacking abilities for all
                    to see. I rank the “multiple reasons” motive fifth, because while it’s definitely
                    understandable that someone’s view of the world influences their decisions, there seems to
                    be a stronger motive under that layer, like financial gain and political activism. I rank
                    the “entertainment” motive sixth because while a lot of people partake in activities just
                    for fun, another aspect of said activity allows people to willingly spend more time on it
                    that is more enticing. An example from the article is that even thought he perpetrator said
                    he did it for fun, he ended up auctioning off the data for money anyways. I rank the
                    “boredom” motive last because from what I read in the article it didn’t really seem like a
                    motive in the first place versus something that gets individuals caught in a trap. Even
                    then, it seems like a little weak because boredom is just a symptom of an underlying problem
                    that causes you to take action.

                    them to spot what makes them fake?</span></li>
            <li>
                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    The average person might not be aware of the differences between a real website that they
                    intend to use, and a malicious website that acts a front to gather information about an
                    individual that intentionally appears legitimate. There are various differences in a fake
                    website that should appear as red flags to a user. Firstly, the most common feature of a
                    fake website is that the domain name may not appear correct. Even if a hacker has setup a
                    website to look like an exact replica, the hacker cannot use the same domain name of the
                    real one. Secondly, web browsers provide a symbol next to the URL that looks like a padlock
                    or another related icon. Clicking on the icon allows you to view the digital certificate of
                    the website, and almost all trustworthy sites will provide a legitimate certification to
                    allow secure connections. If the padlock symbol has a warning sign on it, that may mean the
                    digital certificate is not valid, and cannot be trusted. Lastly, if a user feels that they
                    are not sure they have arrived at the correct website, either through a referral link from
                    an email, or otherwise, the user can always manually go to the intended website themselves
                    and perform the necessary activities from there. Users should look carefully at domain
                    names, and ensure that they are spelled correctly, with no extra characters included to make
                    the domain name appear legitimate. For example, a hacker looking to imitate
                    ‘www.facebook.com’ may register the malicious address as ‘www.face.book.com’. If a URL does
                    not appear to be spelled correctly, the user should not remain there. If a web browser warns
                    you that a digital certificate could be not be validated, that may indicate that the website
                    is unsafe, and users should take heed of said warnings.

                    I think the media has skewed how we understand cybersecurity towards a more fantastical and
                    dramatized point of view. Movies and television have taken a lot of creative liberties when
                    showcasing the process of exploiting vulnerabilities in computer systems. I can definitely
                    understand why though, since in actuality the process of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities is
                    quite “boring”, most of the time. It’s bad enough for your audience to listen to jargon they don’t
                    understand; it’s most likely worse to try and get them read jargon that appears nonsensical to the
                    average person. Another creative liberty that is taken is the timeframe of performing a hack. I’d
                    say 75% of hacking is reconnaissance, and it takes a lot of time. The total amount of time from
                    performing reconnaissance to exploiting a vulnerability might add up to a least a day, if not more.
                    It doesn’t happen within 60 seconds of your first encounter with a system.

                    questions to ask when trying to figure out if someone has a disorderly relationship with their usage
                    of social media. I think that different patterns are found across the world because of cultural
                    differences. Most social media platforms were founded here in the United States, as well as the
                    technology of the internet in general. That definitely plays a role in how our population’s social
                    media usage is influenced. The internet, and especially phones, are vital to navigating society in

                    Social cybersecurity has become an increasingly important part of national security and warfare. Due
                    to the increasing reach of information provided by the internet, it’s strategic value in diplomacy
                    and warfare has skyrocketed. The interconnectedness of the internet, social media, and other online
                    resources has created a new way to conduct warfare, as well as a new way to protect national
                    security. Social media can be used as a tool of disinformation to spread false or misleading
                    information, or to target specific individuals or organizations. It can also be used to gather
                    intelligence and to gain insights into the motivations and intentions of potential adversaries.
                    Additionally, social media can be used to support offensive cyber operations, such as launching
                    malware or other malicious code. Social cybersecurity has also enabled countries to better monitor
                    and respond to threats, as well as to detect and prevent attacks. As the use of social media
                    continues to grow, so too will the need for better and more sophisticated social cybersecurity
                    measures. By leveraging the vast amount of data available on social media platforms, world
                    governments and militaries can gain a better understanding of potential threats and vulnerabilities,
                    as well as gain insight into the activities and intentions of adversaries. Social cybersecurity can
                    also be used to monitor and disrupt malicious actors, particularly in the digital realm.
                    Additionally, it can be used to track and analyze the spread of misinformation and disinformation
                    campaigns, as well as to detect and prevent cyber-attacks. Social cybersecurity can also be used to
                    provide intelligence on strategic issues such as the political and economic climate in a given
                    region, which can be invaluable in making informed decisions. All in all, social cybersecurity has
                    become essential for national security and warfare in the digital age.

                    Week 11: Read this (https://dojmt.gov/wp-content/uploads/Glasswasherparts.com_.pdf) sample breach
                    letter: “SAMPLE DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION”, and describe how two different economics theories and two
                    different social sciences theories relate to the letter.

                    Neoclassical theory states that the customer decides prices due to supply and demand. This relates
                    to the letter in question due to the fact that customer demand for a product made by a company may
                    sharply drop due to events unrelated to the product, such as a cybersecurity breach that has exposed
                    their private information. If customers lose faith that their payment information is safe with a
                    business, they will most likely refuse to conduct further business with that organization. Keynesian
                    economic theory makes the case that when in times of strife, “business pessimism” along with other
                    market factors will increase the weakness of an economy. Business pessimism is an important idea, as
                    it relates heavily to the above letter and business cybersecurity as a whole. Similar to my previous
                    point, if a business’ customer base becomes pessimistic about the security of their information that
                    is stored by a company, the result will be customers cutting ties with the company in search of
                    safer business practices. The two social science theories that relate to this letter would be the
                    functionalist and conflict perspectives. Functionalist theory states that society is built up of a
                    web of relationships with numerous systems, and cybersecurity might turn out to be the most
                    interconnected system within society. Conflict perspective states that society is built of different
                    groups of different interests. If a customer base has a greater interest in the safety of their data
                    and information than the group that runs a business, a cybersecurity incident would have a large
                    impact on an organization.

                    violations and why you think those offenses are serious.

                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    The five most serious violations would be “sharing passwords, addresses, or photos of others”,
                    “collecting information about people younger than 13”, “recording a VoIP call without consent”,
                    “using other people’s internet networks”, and “using copyrighted images”. Sharing passwords,
                    addresses, or photos of others is a serious offense because it’s all information that is at the
                    consent of an individual, and whoever shares it is stripping someone of their right to privacy.
                    Collecting information about people younger than 13 is also a serious offense, because individuals
                    younger than the age of 13 are not able to give consent to sharing information about themselves
                    while understanding the consequences of such an action. Recording a VoIP call without consent is
                    another serious offense, because it also an invasion of someone’s privacy. Almost everyone who uses
                    a phone is under the assumption that what they say can be kept in relative confidentiality, and
                    abusing that fact is morally wrong. Using other people’s internet networks without their knowledge
                    or consent has numerous consequences for the owners of the network. If they pay by data usage, they
                    could incur additional charges through no fault of their own. Any information shared over the
                    internet could also be exposed, and exploited by a malicious user. Finally, using copyrighted images
                    is an offense that affects lots of people’s livelihoods. Many individuals turn their photography
                    into a business, and rely on purchases of their material to sustain a living, and copyrights are an
                    important safeguard for them.

                    Criminologists can use cyber victimization surveys to explore the connections between people and the
                    internet. These surveys involve collecting data on the frequency and types of cyber victimization an
                    individual or group has experienced, such as identity theft, online harassment, or threats. This
                    data can then be analyzed to identify correlations between individuals and the type of cyber
                    victimization they experienced, as well as the potential factors that influence their victimization.
                    This information can be used to understand the consequences of cyber victimization and how
                    individuals feel about their online experiences, allowing for better protection for those at risk of

                    Securing the Human: A Review of Literature on Broadening Diversity in Cybersecurity Education
                    demonstrates the opportunity to diversify the field of cybersecurity and the development of a
                    diverse workforce of proficient computer scientists. This study includes interpretive data
                    collection, through the method of observing and reviewing “literature concentrating on cybersecurity
                    education initiatives for diversification”. There are three research questions present: “What is the
                    current body of work concerning the diversification of the cybersecurity field”, “What are the gaps
                    in education research for the diversification of the cybersecurity field”, and “What approaches are
                    successful or unsuccessful in diversifying the cybersecurity field”. The study utilizes a variety of
                    research methods, including “Open Literature Search Methodology”, “Focused Literature Search
                    Methodology”, and “Coding Results”. The first phase, Open Literature Search Methodology, is defined
                    in the study as “a broad review of literature based on standard approaches employed to increase
                    participation in computing and cybersecurity”. Every member of the study’s working group formed a
                    list of interventions to report on based on their experiences as educators. Each intervention was
                    compared to evidence that had been studied heavily for its efficacy in Computer Science/STEM fields.
                    The second phase, Focused Literature Search Methodology, involved a more specific group of keyword
                    search terms in the ACM Digital Library, including terms like “cybersecurity diversity or
                    under-representation or minorities”. All phases of the study used qualitative analysis to review the
                    literature that was found. This study was effective at understanding cybersecurity through a social
                    lens, as it highlighted the need for more guidelines for educators on how to foster a diverse
                    educational community, in order to respond to the lack thereof. Overall, this study provided methods
                    for educators to help entice and retain a diverse field of students who can join the cybersecurity
                    field.

                    “Developing Metrics to Assess the Effectiveness of Cybersecurity Awareness Programs” is a study that
                    proposes a set of metrics to evaluate cybersecurity awareness programs, then apply those metrics by
                    performing a literature review of 32 different papers. The best forms of cybersecurity involves
                    every individual at every stage, not just the IT staff. Everyone in an organization can learn how to
                    keep themselves and the organization that they represent safe from cyber-threats. The research
                    questions that were focused on within the literature reviews included what factors each paper
                    measured, as well how those factors were measured in relation to cybersecurity awareness. Along with
                    the research questions, the researches applied the European Literacy Policy Network’s four
                    indicators, which are: impact, sustainability, accessibility, and monitoring. The research methods
                    that were used included a systematic literature review developed by researchers Webster and Watson
                    and search services such as Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic. Evaluating these research papers
                    for their effectiveness can contribute to marginalized members of society through providing
                    accessibility to end users of all different backgrounds, not just technology-focused ones. Overall,
                    this study provides a way for those who are developing cybersecurity awareness programs to enhance
                    said programs.
