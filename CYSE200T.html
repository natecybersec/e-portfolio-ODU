                    Cybersecurity plays a vital role in virtually everything we participate in via the internet. Because
                    of this, many other college majors besides cybersecurity can transition a lot of the skills and
                    knowledge gained. These majors include Computer Science, Criminology, Engineering, and Business
                    Administration and Management. Building a foundation in cybersecurity almost certainly requires
                    additional disciplines to be added to your repertoire. Skills and knowledge gained throughout should
                    prove beneficial to a cybersecurity major, regardless of the path they decide to take within the
                    field later on. Cybersecurity is a continuously evolving discipline, and with the intrinsic need to
                    adapt to changes, comes an obligation to learn and discover. This also allows for students to pursue
                    other careers outside of cybersecurity. Computer science majors can bring a solid understanding of
                    the way in which computer systems operate and then apply that knowledge to cybersecurity. Knowledge
                    of computer programming languages and how data is structured is hugely beneficial. Business
                    administration and management majors would be able to use their understanding of the processes of
                    running a business and handling large amounts of business-related data, to build a foundation for
                    ways to protect it through cybersecurity. These processes include risk identification and assessment
                    and implementing strategies to mitigate said risk. Engineering majors can put to use their knowledge
                    of how hardware and/or software is designed, to create a low-level understanding of how systems are
                    penetrated by attackers, as well as thinking up new defenses. Criminology majors and the insight
                    into the criminal justice system that is gained can be absolutely beneficial to a cybersecurity
                    major. With an additional understanding of criminal behavior and pattern recognition, criminology
                    majors can use that information to stop threat actors. Since cybercrime is handled by law
                    enforcement, students can use their understanding of they way law enforcement operates to apprehend
                    cybercriminals.

                    Week 3: Describe four ethical issues that arise when storing electronic information about
                    individuals.
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    Electronic information, according to the “Information Technology Resource Management Glossary”, is
                    known as “any information stored in a format that enables it to be read, processed, manipulated, or
                    transmitted by an information system.” Electronic information can be stored on devices like USB
                    drives, hard drives, or even on a remote server. A variety of ethical issues involved in storing
                    electronic information about individuals come to mind. First, an issue that is still very
                    controversial to this day is that most of the public are not aware of what information about them is
                    being stored, much less the specifics of said information. This means that individuals may not be
                    able to give their consent to store information in an informative manner, and if the information
                    becomes leaked, they may be surprised to learn how much unwanted information will be released to the
                    internet. In addition to this, an individual’s information that they may want to keep private may be
                    accessed by insiders of companies, most notably social media providers like TikTok and Facebook.
                    These actions could result in a serious violation of one’s privacy rights here in the United States.
                    Electronic information about an individual that is stored could also misrepresent an individual, as
                    the information could be inaccurate, especially concerning the age of the data versus the
                    individual’s current and up-to-date information. This gets especially complicated when considering
                    that companies often partake in selling user data to advertising partners. Fortunately for the
                    average user, there are ways to take control of their data and the specifics of what is stored by
                    different companies or organizations. Users should always read the fine print when prompted with
                    data collection, as they can learn more about how an organization stores user data and the contents
                    of what they are storing. Individuals will find that some companies will actually let one opt out,
                    thus negating ethical issues. If it’s the case that you can’t fully opt-out, even then a user should
                    be able to opt out of the selling of their data to other organizations. The ethical issues that
                    arise from storing electronic information about a user should be clear to all organizations who take
                    part, and should be done in a manner that respects an individual’s rights.

            <li>
                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    The risks that cybersecurity tries to mitigate cannot be understated. Critical infrastructure such
                    as power grids or financial systems, sensitive user data collected by organizations, and computer
                    systems in general are all targets of attackers. When discussing the risks to the United States’
                    critical infrastructure’s cybersecurity, there are numerous factors that can contribute. The U.S. is
                    in a unique position due to it natural size, thus the infrastructure is vast and complicated,
                    including an expansive variety of systems and machines that hold things together. Due to the size,
                    it also makes it harder to defend, especially with the seperation of federal, state, and local
                    government oversight. Different states might have different standards for how they protect their
                    infrastructure, with some states leading and some falling behind due to negligent management.
                    Compared to other countries, because of their smaller size, it’s most likely a lot easier to provide
                    oversight to their critical infrastructure and provide a stronger defense. It also makes it a lot
                    easier to update a smaller number of systems than it is a larger number, which results in better
                    defense against zero-day exploits. In terms of risks to sensitive user data collected by
                    organizations, both the U.S. and other countries have their fair share of issues to tackle, since
                    said data is an important commodity globally. Social media is extremely prominent in the world
                    today, with enormous amounts of data being passed back and forth all over the globe. Fortunately,
                    the western part of the world has taken and are continuing to take steps toward protecting users and
                    their right to privacy. The U.S. has various agencies and commissions, like the Federal Trade
                    Commission, that produce safeguards for user data. The European Union has the “General Data
                    Protection Regulation”, also known as “GDPR”, which pushes a set of requirements for organizations
                    to protect user data, as well as notify users of data breaches in a timely manner.

                    Week 6: How has cyber technology created opportunities for workplace deviance?
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    The development of cyber technology has created a new form of workplace deviance. It encompasses the
                    acts of misusing computers, networks, and other technological resources possibly for one’s own
                    personal gain, or to commit a malicious act. This type of deviance can be perpetrated through a
                    variety of avenues, including email, instant messaging, social media, and even through the use of
                    CCTV cameras. One of the most common forms of cyber workplace deviance is data theft of confidential
                    information, such as customer credit cards, corporate passwords, and price lists. This type of data
                    theft can often occur when employees gain access to unauthorized networks or areas of data storage.
                    Additionally, cyber technology can further accentuate workplace deviance through the use of the
                    internet for inappropriate activities, such as playing games, accessing or downloading copyrighted
                    software, or even sending or receiving emails that could harm the company’s reputation or business.
                    In addition to data theft, cyber technology has enabled other types of workplace deviance, such as
                    intellectual property theft, or the misuse of company computer systems for unauthorized activities,
                    such as accessing adult websites. Cyber deviance can also extend to the physical world, with
                    employees using cameras or recording devices to capture confidential meetings or private
                    conversations. Furthermore, in the age of social media with employees whose jobs are solely
                    dedicated to running social media accounts for an organization, there have been instances of
                    employees using social media networks to post false information and communicate false threats on
                    behalf of the company. The proliferation of new cyber technology has both enabled, and decreased the
                    barriers to workplace deviance. On one hand, it has made it easier for employees to get away with
                    stealing confidential data and engaging in other forms of deviant behavior due to the increased
                    anonymity it provides. On the other hand, companies now have the ability to trace many of these
                    activities through forensic investigation and online monitoring systems. This can provide valuable
                    evidence when trying to identify and prosecute those responsible, while also generating awareness of
                    the potential consequences of cyber workplace deviance.

                    Developing cybersecurity programs in businesses can be a costly endeavor, but often times the
                    benefits outweigh the costs. A comprehensive program and strategy should start with identifying
                    risks and assessing the company's current cybersecurity infrastructure, which often requires
                    professional investment. Developing a framework for data protection, as well as recruitment of
                    cybersecurity personnel, can also involve hefty expenses. However, organizations benefit from
                    mitigating cyber threats by protecting their information and investments, avoiding costly data
                    breaches, and safeguarding their customers and their trust. Having a strategy for responding quickly
                    to security events and subsequent investigations can help to limit the damage, protect sensitive
                    data and build stakeholder confidence. This can also prevent legal and reputational costs, and even
                    regulatory or governmental penalties. Technology investments can also play a key role in developing
                    a cybersecurity program. Firewalls, anti-malware software, intrusion detection systems and
                    encryption are necessary steps to secure data, protect communications, and prevent unauthorized
                    access. Advanced security measures, such as multi-factor authentication and data loss prevention,
                    can help to further protect information. Organizations may even invest in processes such as control
                    access granting and user behavior analytics, to track abnormal activity in real-time, and give an
                    early warning if something is amiss. Training initiatives may be integral to ensure a secure
                    environment, and ensure employees are up-to-date on the latest security protocols within the
                    organization. This can also improve relationships with customers, who will see that their data is
                    being kept secure and private. Organizations should also have protocols to monitor, update and test
                    their systems, in order to keep them running safely and efficiently. In conclusion, the costs of
                    developing a comprehensive cybersecurity program in businesses can often be outweighed by the
                    benefits, including increased data security, mitigated threats, improved customer confidence, and
                    compliance with legislation. Investing in the right personnel, processes and technology can be the
                    key to ensuring a secure environment.

                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    An individual can tell if their computer is safe by assessing certain indicators that could suggest
                    the presence of malicious software or other security threats. To begin, it is important for the
                    individual to ensure that their computer is running the latest version of their operating system and
                    any other software running on the machine, as well as its anti-virus program. Newer versions of
                    software often include bug fixes and security updates, which can help protect against malicious
                    attacks. The individual should also pay attention to any new or unfamiliar pop-ups, messages, or
                    browser toolbars that appear on their computer. These could be signs of malicious programs installed
                    on the computer. They should also monitor their computer's performance and look for any sudden
                    decreases in speed or lagging that could be a result of an infection. Individuals can also look at
                    their browsing history to make sure they have not unwittingly visited malicious websites that could
                    have installed malicious programs on their computer. Additionally, they should perform periodic
                    system scans with their anti-virus to check for any malicious software or viruses. For further
                    security, individuals can also use firewalls and VPNs to secure their connections and encrypt their
                    data. This helps protect their personal information from being accessed by hackers or other
                    malicious actors. Last but not least, individuals should make sure that their passwords are strong,
                    and that they are not reusing passwords for multiple sites or services. If they take all the
                    necessary steps, they should be able to tell if their computer is safe or not. However, they should
                    also be aware that no security measures are 100% foolproof, and they should stay up-to-date with the
                    latest security news to keep their system protected. They should also use caution when downloading
                    files, and make sure they only download files from trusted sources. All of these steps should help
                    protect their computer and help them decide on whether or not they are within a safe digital
                    environment.

            <li>
                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    Computers have made the world safer by improving security systems with the help of an enhanced data
                    storage system, which helps keep sensitive personal and financial data away from potential cyber
                    criminals, as well as allowing for faster processing of security checks. For example, there are now
                    banks that use biometric technology to authenticate legit customers, improving overall safety for
                    all transactions. Furthermore, with the power of machine learning and predictive analytics,
                    computers have been able to detect suspicious activities ahead of time, allowing for proactive steps
                    to be taken to prevent any potential crime from taking place. Secondly, computers have significantly
                    reduced workplace fatalities by automating dangerous and often tedious tasks. Many industrial tasks
                    that had been extremely dangerous for workers can now be completed with the help of computers, which
                    drastically reduces the risk of accidents. Computers can also be used to monitor the safety of
                    industrial production plants, identifying possible hazards before they occur and alerting workers to
                    take the necessary precautions. Thirdly, computers have also helped to further police and law
                    enforcement's ability to apprehend criminals. With the help of sophisticated software and facial
                    recognition technology, police can identify criminals more quickly and with greater accuracy.
                    Additionally, computers have also allowed for smarter management of data, allowing police and law
                    enforcement to store and organize files more efficiently, allowing for faster and more effective
                    investigation processes. Computers have also made the world a more dangerous place as well. In
                    recent years, computers have become more and more integrated into daily life, and thus ever more
                    vulnerable to cyberattacks. Computers have made the world less safe by providing attackers with an
                    ever-increasing attack surface. Digital criminals can gain access to sensitive data, steal valuable
                    information, and sabotage computer networks with their malicious activities. With the rise of
                    powerful programs for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, virtual extortion, and other
                    scams, it’s more important than ever to stay ahead of hackers. Computers have made us more
                    vulnerable to attack by introducing a whole new set of unsecured devices. Smartphones, tablets, and
                    other Internet-connected gadgets bring a wide range of convenience and access to digital content,
                    but they also open the door to attackers. Unsecured devices are potential points of entry for
                    malware, allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive data. Thanks to computers, social
                    engineering has become an increasingly prevalent security threat. Although attackers often use
                    malicious software to gain access to people’s systems, there are multiple ways into a system. they
                    craft clever emails to steal confidential information, and they use psychological manipulation to
                    gain access to protected accounts. Online users, especially those working remotely or handling
                    sensitive data, must maintain a vigilant defense against social engineering attacks. In all,
                    computers have made the world less safe by increasing the attack surface and provides attackers with
                    numerous opportunities to exploit our systems.

                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    Engineers work continually to make cyber networks safer and more secure. They develop and implement
                    a variety of technologies, processes and best practices to protect these networks and the data that
                    resides within them. For example, engineers use encryption to encode data transmitted over networks,
                    making it very difficult for attackers to glean any information. They also use authentication to
                    ensure that only authorized users or systems can gain access to data and networks. Engineers monitor
                    network activity to detect malicious activity and unauthorized attempts to access data, and then
                    apply appropriate measures to stop or contain such activities. Firewalls are another tool used to
                    help protect networks. Firewalls are essentially filters that are used to protect computers from
                    malicious software entering via the Internet. Engineers use various techniques to configure
                    firewalls so that only approved traffic can pass through. They also use antivirus software to scan
                    for and remove malicious code that may have already infiltrated a system. Other steps engineers take
                    to protect networks include developing secure coding practices, regularly patching or fixing
                    software vulnerabilities, and restricting user privileges so that users cannot access data they are
                    not authorized to access. They may also engage in penetration testing to detect potential
                    vulnerabilities in networks and systems. In addition to installing and configuring various security
                    tools and systems, engineers must also stay up to date on the latest threats and trends in the
                    industry. They attend conferences and seminars, read industry publications, and actively participate
                    in security research to ensure they have the latest techniques and approaches to protect networks.
                    The job of an engineer is never done when it comes to ensuring the safety and security of cyber
                    networks. To make sure cyber networks are safe and secure, engineers must continually monitor for
                    threats, implement new security measures, and stay informed on the latest trends in the security
                    industry.

                <p class="assignment-body primary-text">
                    The overlap between criminal justice and cybercrime is seen in the increasing use of technology in
                    crime and in the responses to it. Cybercrime is a term that is broadly used to describe criminal
                    activity that involves the use of computers, networks, or other forms of technology to commit a
                    criminal offense. This form of crime is growing significantly each year due to the fact that
                    technology is used widely in our society and criminals are adapting to this new environment. This
                    type of crime requires special attention from law enforcement and criminal justice professionals as
                    the complexity of the crimes involved is typically higher than those found in the traditional world.
                    The overlap between criminal justice and cybercrime can be seen in a variety of areas. One is the
                    need for law enforcement and criminal justice professionals to become increasingly well-versed in
                    computer technology and its associated networks and systems. This involves having a deep
                    understanding of the technical architecture of a network, the availability of tools to access and
                    manage networks, and the methods used by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access. In addition,
                    law enforcement and criminal justice professionals need to be prepared to respond to cyber-attacks
                    and other forms of computer crime. This includes the ability to investigate and prosecute cybercrime
                    cases, as well as to investigate and properly use digital evidence for court proceedings. In this
                    area, there is an increased need for expertise in the fields of digital forensics and the law to
                    effectively investigate the case and present a credible case in court. Finally, criminal justice
                    professionals need to understand the legal and ethical implications of cybercrime in order to ensure
                    that its victims receive justice. In this area, there is a need to understand the legal precedents
                    that have been set in relation to cybercrime, as well as the development of specialized statutes and
                    laws to respond to such crimes. These overlaps relate other disciplines due to the fact that
                    cybersecurity remains a joint effort by multiple fields to make the internet a safer place. It
                    requires legislature, law enforcement, engineers, and many more career paths to keep cybersecurity
                    systems up to date.

                    Cyber technology has drastically changed the nature of interactions between victims and offenders,
                    as it improves the ability to easily connect with people from all over the world, enabling criminals
                    to target victims from locations other than their own. With advancements in technology, those
                    committing criminal acts have a much wider scope of access with which to prey upon victims, this can
                    in turn have a severe impact on the physical and mental wellbeing of the victim. Cyber criminals can
                    commit all kinds of acts that they were unable to do before, such as identity theft, online scams,
                    cyberstalking, cyberbullying, phishing, spam campaigns and other malicious acts. Some offenders may
                    even use cyber technology to obtain personal information of their victims and craft a highly
                    tailored attack. Victims can be exposed to sensitive material, blackmailed with threats to release
                    said material, or coerced into sending money and/or sensitive information to the offender. This type
                    of criminal activity can also have residual impacts on the victims, some of which can be
                    long-lasting. Victims may have an increased risk of mental illness, suicidal thoughts, physical
                    health issues, and social isolation due to the humiliation or embarrassment of the attack. This can
                    be especially true for victims of cyberbullying and cyberstalking, who may experience prolonged
                    distress due to the ongoing nature of the attack. To help combat cybercrimes, organizations such as
                    law enforcement, financial institutions, and social media companies are developing processes and
                    protocols to detect and respond to cyber threats, often in collaboration with government agencies
                    dedicated to protecting citizens online. Non-profit organizations also create campaigns to spread
                    awareness to the public about the dangers of internet activity. Despite these efforts, victims and
                    potential victims should practice online safety by using strong passwords, being vigilant when
                    sharing personal information, and reviewing account activity regularly on all devices.

                    Given the challenges associated with the "short arm" of predictive knowledge when developing
                    cyber-policy and infrastructure, a multi-faceted approach is necessary to ensure that we are able to
                    anticipate potential threats in an ever-changing technological landscape. First, we must actively
                    monitor the cyber-landscape and employ a strategic response capability. This includes deploying
                    innovative technologies and e-government platforms that can reduce the time required to detect and
                    respond to cyber-attacks. It also means leveraging big data and analytics to better identify and

                    of effective policy and infrastructure. Second, a culture of cybersecurity awareness and education
                    must be fostered to ensure that both public and private sector personnel are equipped to understand
                    the implications of cyber-attacks. This includes engaging with the community to promote e-safety,
                    teaching methods to detect and respond to security issues, and providing resources to ensure
                    everyone understands the dangers of cyber-crime. Third, organisations must initiate a long-term
                    commitment to continually review and update their cyber-policy and infrastructure. This means
                    examining existing policies and protocols to ensure they remain up-to-date and are responsive to the
                    needs of the ever-changing digital landscape. It also means equipping staff with the necessary
                    skills to respond swiftly to potential threats. Finally, ensuring we have the resources and
                    infrastructure necessary to quickly hear and respond to the cyber-world is critical. This includes
                    building a secure digital environment with robust architecture and implementing best practice
                    security processes for the protection of critical data. The cyber-world will continue to evolve at a
                    rapid pace, therefore it is important to have an agile and effective approach to policy and
                    infrastructure. By leveraging the latest technologies and analytical frameworks, as well as actively
                    engaging with the community, organisations can ensure they are at the forefront of cyber-security
                    and able to create a safe and secure digital environment.
